# QuakeMap #

## Summary ##
Given the need to monitor the seismic events that happen every day on earth, i decided to create an application that fulfilled this purpose using data provided by the USGS combined with maps of the API of Google Maps.
In this way is possible to monitor earthquakes daily, showing them on a map and watching their feauters such as location, timestamp, magnitude and depth.

## Implementation ##
This application was written using Java 8 in conjunction with the graphics libraries of JavaFX 2.0.
The Google Maps API has been integrated thanks to the work of Rob Terpilowski and Geoff Capper, found at [Sites Using React](https://github.com/rterp/GMapsFX)  

Here you can see two screenshots of my application
